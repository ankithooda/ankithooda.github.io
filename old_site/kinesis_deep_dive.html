        <ul>

            <p>A Kinesis Data Streams is composed of shards which define
                the capacity of the stream. Kinesis Data stream provides
            </p>
            <li><b>Shard</b></li>
            <p>
                Each shard provides 1 MBps of writing throughput and 2 MBps of reading throughput.
                So if the requirement is to have a kinesis stream with 5 MBps maximum capacity, we will
                need to provision a stream with 5 shards.
